### Key Features:
- 🧩 **Pre-Built Agent Templates**: Jumpstart development with role-based agents (e.g., Researchers, Analysts, Vision Specialists).
- 🛠️ **Custom Tools Integration**: Add web search, data analysis, image processing, and more.
- 🤖 **Autonomous Collaboration**: Agents delegate tasks, share goals, and solve problems dynamically.
- 📂 **Production-Ready Structure**: Streamlined project setup with YAML configurations, dependency management, and environment variables.

## 🛠️ Installation
Get started in minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rpabotsworld/crewAI.git

```

## 🎮 Quickstart Example
Create a **Research & Reporting Crew** in 3 steps:

### 1️⃣ Define Agents (`config/agents.yaml`):
```yaml
researcher:
  role: "🔍 Senior AI Researcher"
  goal: "Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI"
  backstory: "A detail-oriented expert with a knack for innovation."

analyst:
  role: "📊 Data Analyst"
  goal: "Transform research into actionable reports"
  backstory: "Your go-to for clear, structured insights."
```

### 2️⃣ Assign Tasks (`config/tasks.yaml`):
```yaml
research_task:
  description: "Investigate trending AI frameworks in 2025"
  agent: researcher
  output_file: "trends.md"

report_task:
  description: "Compile findings into a markdown report"
  agent: analyst
```

### 3️⃣ Run Your Crew:
```bash
python src/main.py
# Output saved to 'trends.md'! 🎉
```
